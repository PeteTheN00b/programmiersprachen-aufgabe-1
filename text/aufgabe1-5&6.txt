Aufgabe 1-5

Initialization - An initialization is to assign a value to a variable at the time of its construction.

Assignment (Zuweisung) - An assignment is to change the value of a variable at any time other than its construction.

	The difference is that an initialization can only happen at the time of a variable's construction,
whereas an assignment can occur at any time except that.

int i = 5; //Assignment style Initialization, but not assignment
i = 3; //Assignment, but not initialization

Aufgabe 1-6

Declaration - A declaration is to tell the compiler that something exists or will exist.

Definition - A definition is to tell the compiler about the implementation of something which has been declared.
	Memory adress for a variable, body for a function and class.

	The difference is that a variable, class or function can be declared without providing its functionality,
thereby telling the compiler that this object exists, but not what this object will do.
	For an object to be defined it must also have been or be declared at the same time.


extern int i; //Declared variable, but not defined

int i; //Defined variable


void p(); //Declared function, but not defined

void p() {std::cout << "Hello World!" << std::endl}; //Defined function


class C; //Declared class

class C { }; //Defined class
